Set my Prayer Times skill generation.
My new Alexa Skill is Called "Set My Prayer Time". The intention was creating a Alexa skill that checks prayer times daily
and set the alarm by calling salah. But it turns out Alexa is not supporting creating alarms by skills yet. My skill is calling 
an API to gather payer time for Boston location and tell you what is the prayer times. Also set alarm by calling Alexa.
Another interesting hurdle was Alexa also not supporting passing the current time on users time zone. we can use the server time 
but it is not the some necessary. This was a quick day project. I have learned how to create Utterans,Intents and Slots.
I have used Node.Js to call API and at the AWS calls.

You can say "open set my prayer times" to reach the skills app.
thanks
